# NodePractice
This repository contains a project assigned as course work to reinforce practical knowledge of Nodes and Linked Lists.

It is my original response to an assignment that I will not specify as to avoid plaigarism.
The idea is to convey a simulation of adding BlueRay Disks to a collection and connect them all by using Nodes.
In this project, the Linked List is searched linearly from the head of the list until reaching the Null end of the list. 
The general functions of the project are to either print a readable form of the BlueRay disks contained in the nodes, or to locate the END of the list and add a new with another disk and a null nextNode.
